<h1>Poptracker for Overwatch 2 AP Manual</h1>

This tracker connects as a manual client, meaning that clicking on locations will actually send checks to the connected multiworld.

There's a location to goal the game in the top-left corner, it will **NEVER** change to green, but it's only clickable if you have the required medal amount.
